## üìä Understanding the Output

### **!optimize Output:**
```
1. David Pastrnak (BOS)
   POINTS OVER 1.5 [DEMON]
   Prob: 92.3% | EV: +107.6%
   Kelly: 21.5% of bankroll
```

**What this means:**
- **POINTS OVER 1.5**: The specific line to bet
- **[DEMON]**: Line type (higher payout, harder to hit)
- **Prob: 92.3%**: Our calculated win probability
- **EV: +107.6%**: Expected value (you make $1.08 per $1 bet on average)
- **Kelly: 21.5%**: Optimal bet size (conservative = divide by 4 = 5.4%)

- **[ELITE]**: Confidence tier (T1-ELITE is best)

## üé∞ Betting Strategy

### **Conservative (Recommended):**
Use **1/4 Kelly** sizing from optimizer:
- If Kelly says 20% ‚Üí Bet 5% of bankroll
- If Kelly says 16% ‚Üí Bet 4% of bankroll

### **Moderate:**
Use **1/2 Kelly** sizing:
- If Kelly says 20% ‚Üí Bet 10% of bankroll

### **Aggressive (Not Recommended):**
Use **Full Kelly** sizing:
- High variance
- Can lose big quickly

---

## üî• Pro Tips

### **1. Always use !optimize before betting**
The optimizer finds better lines than the standard picks!

Example:
- Standard: Ovechkin SOG 3.5 (+45% EV)
- Optimizer finds: Ovechkin Points 0.5 GOBLIN (+47% EV, higher probability!)

### **2. Mix tiers for balance**
Don't bet only T1-ELITE picks. Mix in T2-STRONG for diversification.

### **3. Track your own results**
Use !dashboard daily to ensure the model is working for you.

### **4. Don't chase losses**
If you have a bad day, stick to your bankroll management. The edge plays out over time.

### **5. Focus on demon/goblin lines from optimizer**
These often have better EV than standard lines!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **When games start:**
- Generate picks in the **morning** before games
- Don't wait until games have started

### **Grading timing:**
- Grade **after midnight** when all games are final
- Or grade the **next morning**

### **Database resets:**
- Your picks and history are stored locally
- Back up `database/nhl_predictions.db` regularly

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **"No picks found"**
- Run `!run` first to generate picks
- Make sure you're using correct date format: YYYY-MM-DD

### **"Automation failed"**
- Check that all scripts are in the project folder
- Ensure database folder exists
- Try running manually: `python complete_automation.py`

### **"No positive EV picks found"**
- This is rare but possible
- Lower the EV threshold in `optimize_ev.py` (line 275)
- Or just use `!picks` for standard recommendations

### **Bot not responding**
- Check bot is online (green dot in Discord)
- Restart bot: `python discord_bot.py`
- Verify token is set correctly
