**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Auditor:** Claude Code

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of NHL PrizePicks betting system identifying critical fixes implemented and additional optimization opportunities.

---

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Probability Extrapolation (FIXED)
**Issue:** Linear decay caused 50% over-confidence in difficult lines
- William Eklund O1.5 points: 70.4% ‚Üí **48.2%** (32% reduction)
- Parlay probabilities: 67% ‚Üí **46%** (realistic)

**Fix:** Exponential decay with stat-specific rates
- Points: 0.60 decay (aggressive)
- Shots: 0.72 decay (moderate)
- Impact: Prevents overconfident bets, better bankroll management

---

## üîç OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES FOUND

### 2. PrizePicks API Parsing (BROKEN) ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** CRITICAL - Currently not fetching edges

**Issue:**
```python
# Player names showing as "Unknown"
# Included section not being parsed correctly
```

**Impact:** Cannot generate fresh edges, relying on old data

**Fix Needed:**
- Update `prizepicks_multi_line_optimizer.py` line ~80-145
- Parse 'included' section for player names (type: 'new_player')
- Map player IDs to projection data

**Priority:** HIGH - System cannot function without this

---

### 3. Learned Multipliers Too Conservative
**Issue:** Reverse-engineered multipliers from parlays are pessimistic
- Standard: 1.732x (fallback) vs ~2.3x (learned from 1 observation)
- Result: Finding 0 edges even with 0% EV threshold

**Current State:**
- Temporarily disabled learned multipliers
- Using fallback assumptions (working but less accurate)

**Optimization:**
- Need 50-100 parlay observations for accurate learning
- Current: Only 1 observation per line (70% confidence, not enough)
- Action: Continue logging parlays, retrain after 50+ observations

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Fallback working but less optimal

---

### 4. Data Staleness Detection
**Current:** 2-hour threshold triggers full refresh

**Optimization:**
- Different thresholds by data type:
  - Player stats: 6 hours (stable)
  - Game odds: 1 hour (changes faster)
  - Goalie matchups: 4 hours (moderate)
- Partial refreshes instead of full refresh
- Impact: Fewer API calls, faster updates

**Priority:** LOW - Current system working

---

### 5. GTO Optimizer Filtering
**Issue:** Filtering logic runs AFTER loading from database

**Current Flow:**
```
Load 56 edges ‚Üí Filter to 25 (GOBLIN/STANDARD priority)
```

**Optimization:**
```sql
-- Filter in SQL query instead
WHERE odds_type IN ('goblin', 'standard')
  OR (odds_type = 'demon' AND player_name NOT IN (...))
```

**Impact:** Faster queries, less memory

**Priority:** LOW - Performance fine with current dataset size

---

### 6. Database Schema Optimizations
**Current:** Missing indexes on frequently queried columns

**Add Indexes:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_predictions_date_tier ON predictions(game_date, confidence_tier);
CREATE INDEX idx_edges_date_edge ON prizepicks_edges(date, edge);
CREATE INDEX idx_parlays_date ON gto_parlays(date);
```

**Impact:** Faster queries (currently ~50-100 rows, will matter at scale)

**Priority:** LOW - Dataset small, but good practice

---

### 7. File Output Redundancy
**Issue:** Generating both TXT and CSV for picks
- LATEST_PICKS.txt (human-readable)
- LATEST_PICKS.csv (machine-readable)
- PICKS_2025-10-30_XX-XXPM.txt (archive)
- PICKS_2025-10-30_XX-XXPM.csv (archive)

**Optimization:**
- Keep CSV only (works for both humans and machines)
- Reduce Git commits (fewer files)
- Faster workflow

**Priority:** LOW - Convenience vs efficiency tradeoff

---

### 8. Git Auto-Commit Strategy
**Current:** Commits every workflow run (4x daily = 120/month)

**Optimization:**
- Only commit when picks change significantly
- Use diff to detect changes
- Reduce commit noise

**Code:**
```python
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['git', 'diff', '--quiet', 'LATEST_PICKS.csv'])
if result.returncode != 0:  # Changes detected
    # Commit
```

**Priority:** LOW - Not affecting performance

---

### 9. Prediction Model Ensemble Weights
**Current:** XGBoost + Statistical model, fixed weights

**Optimization:**
- Dynamic weighting based on recent performance
- If statistical model hitting 75%, increase weight
- If XGBoost struggling, decrease weight
- Retrain weights monthly

**Implementation:**
```python
def get_adaptive_weights():
    recent_performance = query_last_30_days_accuracy()
    stat_weight = min(0.8, recent_performance['statistical'] / 0.75)
    ml_weight = 1.0 - stat_weight
    return stat_weight, ml_weight
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Could improve accuracy 2-5%

---

### 10. Correlation Detection in Parlays
**Current:** Avoids same-game and same-team parlays

**Optimization:**
- Detect stat correlations (e.g., SOG highly correlated with Points)
- Avoid parlays like:
  - Player A shots + Player A points (correlated)
  - Linemate A points + Linemate B points (correlated)
- Use correlation matrix from historical data

**Impact:** Reduce variance, more reliable parlays

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Could improve parlay hit rate 5-10%

---

### 11. Bankroll Management Integration
**Current:** Kelly sizing calculated but not enforced

**Optimization:**
- Track actual bankroll in database
- Enforce bet sizing limits
- Warn if recommended bets exceed 20% of bankroll
- Auto-adjust sizing if bankroll changes

**Implementation:**
```python
class BankrollManager:
    def __init__(self, initial_bankroll):
        self.current_bankroll = initial_bankroll

    def get_bet_size(self, kelly_pct, max_risk=0.05):
        recommended = self.current_bankroll * kelly_pct
        max_bet = self.current_bankroll * max_risk
        return min(recommended, max_bet)
```

**Priority:** HIGH - Prevents overbetting

---

### 12. Error Handling & Logging
**Current:** Print statements for debugging

**Optimization:**
- Structured logging with levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Log to file for debugging
- Slack/Discord notifications on critical errors

**Implementation:**
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('system.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Easier debugging

---

### 13. API Rate Limiting
**Current:** No rate limiting on NHL API calls

**Optimization:**
- Add exponential backoff on 429/503 errors
- Cache responses for 5 minutes
- Batch requests where possible

**Implementation:**
```python
from time import sleep

def fetch_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=15)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response
        except requests.HTTPError as e:
            if e.response.status_code == 429:
                wait = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
                sleep(wait)
            else:
                raise
```

**Priority:** LOW - No rate limit issues yet

---

### 14. TOI Predictions Integration
**Current:** TOI system generates predictions but not integrated with main picks

**Optimization:**
- Add TOI predictions to main prediction pipeline
- Include in edge detection
- PrizePicks offers TOI lines (overlooked opportunity)

**Impact:** More betting opportunities

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Expand betting surface

---

### 15. Grading Automation
**Current:** Auto-grades yesterday 6-11 AM only

**Optimization:**
- Auto-grade when all games final (check API)
- Don't wait until next morning
- Faster feedback loop

**Implementation:**
```python
def all_games_final(date):
    games = fetch_game_results(date)
    return all(g['gameState'] == 'OFF' for g in games)

# Run grading when last game finishes
```

**Priority:** LOW - Morning grading working fine

---
