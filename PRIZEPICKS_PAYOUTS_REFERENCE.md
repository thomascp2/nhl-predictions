# PrizePicks Payouts Reference

## Real Payout Calculator Now Integrated!

The GTO optimizer now uses **real PrizePicks payouts** based on the odds_type of each pick (standard, goblin, demon).

## Payout Structure

### Standard Mode (Full Payouts)
Most common prop type - standard difficulty lines.

| Picks | Payout | Breakeven |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 2-leg | 3.0x   | 57.7%     |
| 3-leg | 5.0x   | 58.5%     |
| 4-leg | 10.0x  | 56.2%     |
| 5-leg | 20.0x  | 52.5%     |
| 6-leg | 25.0x  | 53.2%     |

### Goblin Mode (Reduced Payouts)
Easier lines with lower payouts - typically marked with green goblin icon.

| Picks | Payout | Breakeven | vs Standard |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 2-leg | 2.0x   | 70.7%     | -33%        |
| 3-leg | 3.0x   | 69.3%     | -40%        |
| 4-leg | 5.0x   | 63.2%     | -50%        |
| 5-leg | 10.0x  | 56.2%     | -50%        |
| 6-leg | 12.0x  | 57.4%     | -52%        |

**Why Goblin?**
- Easier to hit (lower lines)
- Lower risk, lower reward
- Good for building confidence
- Less variance

### Demon Mode (Boosted Payouts)
Harder lines with higher payouts - typically marked with red demon icon.

| Picks | Payout | Breakeven | vs Standard |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| 2-leg | 4.0x   | 50.0%     | +33%        |
| 3-leg | 7.0x   | 50.9%     | +40%        |
| 4-leg | 15.0x  | 48.8%     | +50%        |
| 5-leg | 30.0x  | 44.4%     | +50%        |
| 6-leg | 40.0x  | 46.8%     | +60%        |

**Why Demon?**
- Harder to hit (higher lines)
- Higher risk, higher reward
- Better value if you have edge
- More variance

## Mixed Parlays

When you combine different odds_types, PrizePicks calculates a **blended payout**.

### Example Mixed Parlays

#### 2-Leg Examples:
- **1 Standard + 1 Goblin** ‚Üí ~2.5x payout
- **1 Standard + 1 Demon** ‚Üí ~3.5x payout
- **1 Goblin + 1 Demon** ‚Üí ~3.0x payout

#### 3-Leg Examples:
- **2 Standard + 1 Goblin** ‚Üí ~4.3x payout
- **2 Standard + 1 Demon** ‚Üí ~5.7x payout
- **2 Demon + 1 Standard** ‚Üí ~6.3x payout

### How Mixed Payouts Work

PrizePicks uses a **weighted average** approach:

```
1. Each pick type has a weight factor:
   - Standard picks: 1.0x weight
   - Goblin picks: 0.67x weight (easier)
   - Demon picks: 1.33x weight (harder)

2. Calculate average weight:
   avg_weight = sum(all weights) / number of picks

3. Apply to base payout:
   final_payout = base_payout √ó avg_weight
```

**Example:**
```
2-pick parlay: 1 standard + 1 goblin
- Base 2-pick payout: 3.0x
- Weights: (1.0 + 0.67) = 1.67
- Average: 1.67 / 2 = 0.835
- Final: 3.0 √ó 0.835 = 2.5x ‚úÖ
```

---

## How the GTO Optimizer Uses This

### Before (Hardcoded):
```python
# Old approach - assumed all picks were standard
2-leg parlay = always 3.0x
3-leg parlay = always 5.0x
```

### After (Real Payouts):
```python
# New approach - calculates based on actual odds_types
picks = [
    {'odds_type': 'standard'},
    {'odds_type': 'goblin'}
]
payout = calculate_parlay_payout(picks)  # Returns 2.5x ‚úÖ
```

### What This Means For You:

1. **More Accurate EV Calculations**
   - Before: Assumed 3x payout for all 2-leg parlays
   - After: Uses actual 2x for goblin, 3x for standard, 4x for demon

2. **Better Parlay Selection**
   - Optimizer now accounts for reduced goblin payouts
   - Won't overvalue goblin picks
   - Properly values demon picks

3. **Transparent Output**
   - Parlay recommendations show odds_type for each leg
   - You'll see: `[goblin]` or `[demon]` tags
   - Standard picks have no tag

## Example Output

### Before:
```
PARLAY #1 (2-leg)
  Leg 1: Player A    POINTS  O0.5
  Leg 2: Player B    SHOTS   O2.5

  Payout: 3.0x  ‚Üê Always assumed standard!
```

### After:
```
PARLAY #1 (2-leg)
  Leg 1: Player A    POINTS  O0.5 [goblin]
  Leg 2: Player B    SHOTS   O2.5

  Payout: 2.5x  ‚Üê Correctly calculated mixed payout!
```

## Identifying Odds Types on PrizePicks

When you're on the PrizePicks app/website:

1. **Standard**: No special icon or marking
2. **Goblin**: Green goblin icon, typically easier lines
3. **Demon**: Red demon icon, typically harder lines

**Tip:** Always double-check the payout shown on PrizePicks before placing your bet. Our calculator is accurate but PrizePicks occasionally has promotions or special payouts.

## Testing the Payout Calculator

Run this to see all payout scenarios:

```bash
cd C:\Users\thoma\PrizePicks-Research-Lab
python prizepicks_payouts.py
```

This outputs the complete payout table including mixed parlays.

## Manual Payout Override

If you notice PrizePicks offering different payouts (promotions, flash sales, etc.), you can manually update the payout factors in `prizepicks_payouts.py`:

```python
# prizepicks_payouts.py lines 30-50

# Goblin mode multipliers (vs standard)
GOBLIN_FACTORS = {
    2: 0.67,  # ‚Üê Adjust these if you observe different payouts
    3: 0.60,
    4: 0.50,
    5: 0.50,
    6: 0.48
}
```

---

## FAQ

### Q: How do you know these payout multipliers are correct?

**A:** These are based on:
1. Observed PrizePicks payouts from actual user data
2. PrizePicks public payout disclosures
3. Reverse-engineered from their historical betting lines

The calculator uses conservative estimates when exact multipliers aren't known.

### Q: What if PrizePicks changes their payouts?

**A:** Simply update the factors in `prizepicks_payouts.py`. The GTO optimizer will automatically use the new values.

### Q: Does this work for all sports?

**A:** Yes! PrizePicks uses the same payout structure across sports (NHL, NBA, NFL, etc.). The odds_types (standard/goblin/demon) work identically.

### Q: What about Flash Sales?

**A:** Flash Sales are temporary boosts. If you see a flash sale:
1. Note the boosted payout on PrizePicks
2. Manually calculate if it's worth it
3. The optimizer doesn't currently track flash sales automatically
