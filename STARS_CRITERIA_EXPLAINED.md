## 🎯 **EXACT FILTERING CRITERIA**

For a pick to appear in "FAVORABLE MATCHUPS ONLY", it must pass **ALL 5 filters**:

### **Filter 1: Player Must Be a Star**
- Must be in curated list of **50 elite players**
- See full list below

### **Filter 2: Minimum Confidence Tier**
- **T1-ELITE** (≥85% probability) ✅ PASS

### **Filter 3: High Over/Under**
- **Minimum:** 5.5 goals expected

- **Example:** Defensive game with O/U 5.0 ❌ REJECTED

### **Filter 4: Not Heavy Favorite**
- **Maximum:** Team moneyline ≤ -175

### **Filter 5: Not Heavy Underdog**
- **Maximum:** Team moneyline ≤ +150

---

## 🔍 **WHY THESE SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS?**

### **Over/Under ≥5.5 Goals**
- **League Average:** ~6.0 goals per game

- **5.5-6.5:** Average scoring environment ✅
- **6.5+:** High-scoring game, best for props ⭐

### **Moneyline -175 to +150**
- **Heavy Favorite (<-175):** Overpriced, less value, may rest players up big
- **Heavy Underdog (>+150):** Likely to get outshot, worse game script
- **Sweet Spot (-175 to +150):** Competitive game, good value ✅

### **Tier T2-STRONG or Better**
- **T1-ELITE (≥85%):** Expected 73-75% hit rate
- **T2-STRONG (65-84%):** Expected 65-70% hit rate
- **T3-SOLID (<65%):** Expected 55-60% hit rate - too risky
