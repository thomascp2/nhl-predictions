# üé∞ GTO Parlay Optimizer - Complete Guide

## üéØ What Is This?

The **GTO (Game Theory Optimal) Parlay Optimizer** builds +EV parlays using frequency allocation similar to poker solvers. Instead of randomly combining picks, it strategically distributes your best picks across multiple parlays to maximize long-term expected value while managing risk.

---

## üß† How It Works

### Traditional Approach (What Most Bettors Do)
```
‚ùå Pick highest EV plays
‚ùå Combine them all in one big parlay
‚ùå Either win big or lose everything
‚ùå Overuse best picks, underuse good picks
```

### GTO Approach (What We Do)
```
‚úÖ Assign frequency targets based on EV (like poker hand ranges)
‚úÖ Build multiple parlays with balanced exposure
‚úÖ Ensure picks aren't correlated (same game/team)
‚úÖ Use Kelly criterion for optimal bet sizing
‚úÖ Maximize portfolio EV, not individual parlay EV
```

---

## üîë Key Concepts

### 1. Frequency Allocation
Just like GTO poker solvers assign frequencies to hands:
- **15%+ EV picks** ‚Üí Max frequency (20 appearances)
- **10-15% EV picks** ‚Üí High frequency (16 appearances)
- **7-10% EV picks** ‚Üí Medium frequency (12 appearances)
- **5-7% EV picks** ‚Üí Low frequency (8 appearances)
- **3-5% EV picks** ‚Üí Minimum frequency (5 appearances)

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Best picks get maximum exposure
- ‚úÖ Good picks don't get ignored
- ‚úÖ Balanced portfolio distribution

### 2. Correlation Avoidance
The optimizer automatically rejects parlays with:
- Same game (e.g., Matthews POINTS + Nylander POINTS in TOR vs CBJ)
- Same team (e.g., two Maple Leafs players)

Why? Correlated picks reduce true probability:
```python
# Independent picks (different games):
Matthews 75% √ó Kucherov 70% = 52.5% ‚úÖ

# Correlated picks (same game):
Matthews 75% √ó Nylander 75% ‚â† 56.25% ‚ùå
# True probability is lower because if Matthews struggles,
# Nylander probably struggles too (same game conditions)
```

### 3. Kelly Criterion Sizing
Each parlay gets optimal bet size using fractional Kelly:
```python
# Kelly formula:
f = (bp - q) / b
where:
    b = payout - 1
    p = win probability
    q = 1 - p

# We use Quarter Kelly (25%) for safety
bet_size = bankroll √ó kelly √ó 0.25
```

Example:
```
Parlay: 55% probability, 3x payout
Kelly = (2 √ó 0.55 - 0.45) / 2 = 0.325 (32.5%)
Quarter Kelly = 32.5% √ó 0.25 = 8.1%

With $1000 bankroll:
Bet size = $1000 √ó 0.081 = $81
```

## üìä PrizePicks Payout Structure

The optimizer uses real PrizePicks payouts:

| Legs | Payout | Breakeven | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 2-leg | 3.0x | 57.7% | Standard Power Play |
| 3-leg | 5.0x | 58.5% | Good for balanced parlays |
| 4-leg | 10.0x | 56.2% | High risk, high reward |
| 5-leg | 20.0x | 52.5% | Lottery ticket territory |

**Why this matters:**
- Your model says each pick is 70% ‚Üí Parlay should be 70%^2 = 49% (2-leg)
- PrizePicks pays 3x ‚Üí Breakeven is 33.3%
- **Your edge:** 49% - 33.3% = **+15.7% EV** ‚úÖ

## üöÄ How To Use

### Step 1: Run Complete Workflow
```bash
cd C:\Users\thoma\PrizePicks-Research-Lab
python run_complete_workflow_gto.py
```

This runs:
1. Generates predictions (with smart data refresh)
2. Finds PrizePicks edge (7%+ edge plays)
3. **Builds GTO-optimized parlays**

### Step 2: Review Output

The optimizer shows:

## üí∞ Betting Strategy

### Bankroll Allocation
```
$1000 Bankroll Example:

Singles (Individual Picks):
- Nylander POINTS O0.5 (15% edge): $30 (3%)
- Matthews SHOTS O2.5 (12% edge):  $25 (2.5%)
- Marchenko SHOTS O2.5 (10% edge): $20 (2%)
Total Singles Risk: $75 (7.5%)

Parlays (GTO Optimized):
- 2-leg Parlay #1: $47 (4.7%)
- 2-leg Parlay #2: $35 (3.5%)
- 3-leg Parlay #1: $28 (2.8%)
Total Parlay Risk: $110 (11%)

TOTAL RISK: $185 (18.5% of bankroll)
```

### Risk Management Rules
1. **Never risk more than 20% of bankroll per day**
2. **Use Quarter Kelly (25%) for parlays**
3. **Singles should be 50% of total risk**
4. **Parlays should be 50% of total risk**
5. **Track results daily, adjust if hit rate drops**

## üìà Expected Performance

### Theoretical Performance
If your model is accurately calibrated:

```
Singles Portfolio (10 picks):
- Average edge: 10%
- Hit rate: 73%
- Average bet: $25
- Expected daily: +$25 (10% of $250)

Parlays Portfolio (5 parlays):
- Average edge: 15%
- Hit rate: 45%
- Average bet: $35
- Expected daily: +$26 (15% of $175)

TOTAL EXPECTED: +$51/day (+5.1% ROI)
```

### Reality Check
- Variance is HIGH (especially on parlays)
- Some days you'll lose everything
- Some days you'll 10x
- **Long-term is what matters**

Week-by-week expectations:
```
Week 1: -$150 (bad variance)
Week 2: +$420 (2 big parlays hit)
Week 3: -$80 (close calls)
Week 4: +$290 (solid week)
Month Total: +$480 (+12% ROI)
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Why don't we just parlay all the best picks together?
**A:** That creates massive correlation risk and over-exposes you to variance. GTO balancing spreads risk across multiple uncorrelated parlays.

### Q: What if I don't have a $1000 bankroll?
**A:** Scale down proportionally. With $100 bankroll:
- Singles: $2-5 each
- Parlays: $3-8 each
- Total risk: $15-20/day

### Q: How often should parlays hit?
**A:** Depends on legs:
- 2-leg at 70% each: ~49% hit rate
- 3-leg at 70% each: ~34% hit rate
- 4-leg at 70% each: ~24% hit rate

If your hit rate is significantly lower, your probability estimates are too optimistic.

### Q: Can I use this for other sports?
**A:** Yes! Just adjust:
1. Load picks from different API (NFL/NBA)
2. Update payout structure if different
3. Run optimizer as normal

### Q: What if PrizePicks changes payouts?
**A:** Update `calculate_parlay_payout()` in `gto_parlay_optimizer.py`:
```python
# Line 114
prizepicks_payouts = {
    2: 3.0,  # Update if changed
    3: 5.0,
    4: 10.0,
    5: 20.0,
    6: 25.0
}
```

## üö® Important Disclaimers

1. **Past performance ‚â† future results**
2. **Sports betting has variance** - even +EV bets lose
3. **Only bet what you can afford to lose**
4. **Track results religiously** - if hit rate drops, stop betting
5. **Legal compliance** - ensure sports betting is legal in your jurisdiction
6. **Responsible gambling** - set limits, take breaks, seek help if needed

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Run workflow 2-3x per day** - lines update, new games added
2. **Focus on 2-leg parlays** - best risk/reward ratio
3. **Avoid 5+ leg parlays** - lottery tickets, not +EV
4. **Diversify across games** - reduces correlation risk
5. **Never chase losses** - stick to Kelly sizing
6. **Grade results daily** - adjust if model drifts
7. **Keep detailed records** - IRS wants records, you want data

---

## üìû Support

Issues? Questions? Improvements?

1. Check output logs for error messages
2. Verify database has edge plays: `python -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('database/nhl_predictions.db'); print(pd.read_sql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prizepicks_edges WHERE date = \"2025-10-29\"', conn))"`
3. Re-run workflow if edge plays exist but optimizer fails
