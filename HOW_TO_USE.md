**When you want picks:**

```

## Two Ways to Run

### Method 1: Manual (Run Anytime)

```bash
python generate_picks_to_file.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Generates fresh predictions (~90 seconds)
2. Pulls T1-ELITE picks from database
3. Saves to timestamped file: `PICKS_2025-10-27_10-19PM.txt`
4. Saves to easy file: `LATEST_PICKS.txt`
5. Auto-pushes to GitHub
6. Prints URLs to view online

**When to use:** Anytime you want fresh picks before placing bets

---

### Method 2: Auto-Schedule (Morning to Evening)

```bash
python run_picks_throughout_day.py
```

**What it does:**
- Runs immediately
- Then auto-runs at: 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM
- Updates picks throughout the day
- Stops after 6 PM
- Leave window open and forget about it

**When to use:** Run once in the morning, let it update picks all day

```

- Minimize the window

### Throughout Day (At Work/On The Go)
- Open bookmark: https://github.com/thomascp2/nhl-predictions/blob/main/LATEST_PICKS.txt
- Read your T1-ELITE picks
- Place bets
- Refresh before each betting window

### Evening (After 6 PM)

- Check LATEST_PICKS.txt one more time
- Done!

## Tips

1. **Bookmark the GitHub URL** on your phone/work computer
2. **Focus on T1-ELITE only** (73-75% accuracy)
3. **Check probability & EV** - Higher is better
4. **Run before betting windows** - Fresh data matters
5. **Timestamped files = history** - Compare picks over time

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Script failed to push to GitHub?**
- Picks are still saved locally in the files
- Check internet connection
- Run `git push` manually

**Q: No picks available?**
- Models need data - run earlier in the day
- Check database has recent games
- Try T2-STRONG picks (still good!)

**Q: Want to stop auto-scheduler?**
- Press Ctrl+C in the window
- Or just close the window

**Q: GitHub link not updating?**
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check timestamp at top of file
- Make sure script said "Successfully pushed to GitHub!"
